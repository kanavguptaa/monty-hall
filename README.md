# monty-hall
This Python program replicates the Monty Hall problem to verify the probability of winning a car when switching doors versus not switching. The Monty Hall problem is a well-known game-theory problem based on a game show where a contestant chooses one of three doors. 

Behind one door is a car, while the other two doors hide goats.

The program confirms that switching doors increases the probability of winning the car to 66.6%
